# pyhton-2dRoombaGame

this is a small game about a roomba cleaning a house, but before you start playing!

you need to have python 3.10 or higher installed, here's a link: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

and there is a .bat file, if you run this file it will install the "pygame" and "numpy" libraries needed for the game
if windows gives a warning just open the .bat file in any text editor and copy/paste the commands in your terminal

more information of the game is given in the instructions tab in the game itself, goodluck!

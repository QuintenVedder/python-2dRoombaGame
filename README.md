# pyhton-2dRoombaGame

this is a small game about a roomba cleaning a house, but before you start playing!

you need to have python 3.10 or higher installed, here's a link: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

and there is a .bat file, if you run this file it will install the "pygame" and "numpy" libraries needed for the game

more information of the game is given in the instructions tab in the game itself, goodluck!
